This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Build and Deploy with Docker

This project includes Dockerfiles for both Node and Bun, located in the `docker/` directory.
These can be used standalone, but we also include `docker-compose.yaml`, which defaults to using the Node version.

To build and deploy using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Docker Compose is installed on your system.

2. **Build the Docker image**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. **Start the application**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   The app will be accessible at `http://localhost:3001`.

4. **Stop the container**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
